Just discovered that the system I use to make the differences between genes small is actually counterproductive.
How joyous I am at last! Compression still doesn't work, but I've got a hunch about how to improve it:

* find a very good sorting for the genes so that their mask difference as a power skip index is smaller
* make an algorithm for the XNF improvement which takes in consideration the fact that the genes beyond the file size can be changed freely,
        I'm not sure how much this would help, but i need to try
        The problem is that it's a complicated issue that I've never been able to resolve.
